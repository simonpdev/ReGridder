# ReGridder
A C# Windows Forms App that works on image grids and can:
- Change the size of each cell to a desired value
- Automatically remove padding from the top and right borders according to the contents of the cells

Note: setting a cell size higher/lower than the base one adds/removes pixels from the top and right borders
